      <h2>Hello.</h2>
      <p>I am an accomplished photographer, videographer, graphic designer, and web designer, with a passion for
        creating stunning visuals that captivate and inspire. Born and raised in the vibrant country of Iran, I have
        always been drawn to the power of visual communication, and it was this fascination that led me to pursue a
        career in media design.

        After completing my Bachelor's degree in English Translation at Isfahan University in Iran, I found myself
        increasingly drawn to the world of design. It all began when I volunteered to design the faculty's foreign
        language magazine as a side project. This experience ignited a spark within me, and I soon realized that this
        was my calling. Each year, as I continued to refine my skills and expand my knowledge, my passion for design
        grew stronger.

        In pursuit of my dreams, I decided to move to Ottawa, Canada, to further my education and develop my skills in
        this field. It was a bold move, but one that has paid off in spades. Today, I am proud to be a highly skilled
        and versatile designer, with a wealth of experience across multiple mediums and platforms.

        Whether I am behind the camera, designing a website, or creating a graphic masterpiece, my goal is always the
        same: to create work that is visually stunning, emotionally powerful, and unforgettable. And with each new
        project, I continue to push the boundaries of what is possible, always striving for excellence and innovation.

        My journey in media design has been an exciting and fulfilling one, and I am excited to see where it will take
        me next.</p>
