# portfolio

In terms of my process for creating my web portfolio, I began by conducting research on other portfolio websites and identifying what I liked and disliked about them. From there, I created a plan for my own portfolio, including the goals, target audience, and content that would be included.

During the design phase, I faced some challenges in finding the right color scheme and typography to use. I also had trouble deciding on the layout and user experience. To overcome these challenges, I did some additional research and asked for feedback from others. I also experimented with different designs until I found one that worked well for my portfolio.

During the development phase, I encountered some technical difficulties with coding certain features, such as a contact form and responsive design for mobile devices. To overcome these challenges, I utilized online resources such as Stack Overflow and reached out to other developers for advice. I also spent extra time testing the website on different devices and making adjustments as necessary.

Overall, creating my web portfolio taught me a lot about the importance of planning, design, and development. I learned that it's important to seek feedback and utilize online resources when facing challenges. Finally, the list of assets and resources I used for my portfolio includes the Bootstrap framework for responsive design, Google Fonts for typography, and Unsplash for images. I also used various plugins and libraries for features such as a contact form and social media icons.
